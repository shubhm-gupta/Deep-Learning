# Deep-Learning

Deep learning is one of the most popular technologies in Machine Learning. Deep learning (also known as deep structured learning or hierarchical learning) is part of a broader family of neural network methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNN)s.

Deep learning is one of the machine learning method that takes in an input X, and uses it to predict an output of Y. Given a large dataset of input and output pairs, a deep learning algorithm will try to minimize the difference between its prediction and expected output. By doing this, it tries to learn the association/pattern between given inputs and outputs — this in turn allows a deep learning model to generalize to inputs that it hasn’t seen before. Deep Learning Algorithms use a neural network to find associations between a set of inputs and outputs. The “**deep**” part of deep learning refers to creating deep neural networks. This refers a neural network with a large amount of layers — with the addition of more weights and biases, the neural network improves its ability to approximate more complex functions.

Here is a sample Deep Learning Network, I Designed using [TensorFlow Playground](https://playground.tensorflow.org/) to demonstrate a how Deep Learning Neural Network looks like:

In this exercise, I will build a Deep Learning Network multiple hidden layers using Tensorflow & Keras and apply to the "Adult Census Income" Dataset to classify the income dataset. I will build three different structures and try to compare the results. I will evaluate and compare all three models using standard Classification Metrices and understand how much to go deep when building a Deep Learning Network. At the end, we will visualise the results.
